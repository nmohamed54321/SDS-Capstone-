## 📖 About
This project provides a conservative and comprehensive accounting of the impacts 
made by Pedal People. Based on research by **Matthew Denny** and **Megan Svoboda**, 
it highlights how a small-footprint cooperative can contribute significantly to a 
local economy ($390k in 2011) and the environment (75,000 lbs CO2 reduction/year).

## ✨ Features
- **Economic Tracking:** Calculates local job creation and wage comparisons.
- **Environmental Metrics:** Monitors CO2 reduction and landfill diversion.
- **MVC Architecture:** Separation of data (Models), logic (Controllers), and 
  display (Views).
